# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-read_file.py)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm


### [1. Insertion sort](./1-number_of_lines.py)
*Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm


### [2. Selection sort ](./2-read_lines.py)
*Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm


### [3. Quick sort](./3-write_file.py)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
